            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <hr>

            <p>Tempest will collab in a joint space exploration mission with Rocket Lab to investigate our neighbouring
                planets and local surroundings. The goal of this mission is to get a better understanding of our solar
                system. This could lead to ground-breaking discoveries and further technical improvements. The mission
                will be carried out using a robotic satellite equipped with scientific instruments including visual,
                infrared, and ultraviolet cameras, magnetometers, metal detectors, gravimeters, light intensity sensors,
                radio spectrum detectors, and a propulsion system. To successfully complete this mission, we will be
                teaming up with Rocket lab for the launch of the satellite. We aim to ensure a smooth and successful
                mission, and for that we will need to go through some crucial steps, before we can launch. </p>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Tempest is set to embark on an exciting space exploration mission in collaboration with Rocket Labs and
                the New Zealand Space Agency (NZSA). This groundbreaking mission aims to delve deeper into the mysteries
                of our solar system by investigating a range of celestial bodies surrounding Earth.</p>

            <p> primary objective is to enhance our understanding of the solar system's composition and dynamics.
                This involves studying planetary surfaces, examining asteroid and cometary structures, and exploring the
                outer reaches of our cosmic neighborhood. By leveraging advanced technology and innovative research
                methodologies, the mission seeks to gather critical data that could offer new insights into planetary
                formation, celestial mechanics, and the potential for life beyond Earth.</p>

            <p>In addition to the scientific goals, this collaboration emphasizes international partnership and
                technological advancement. By pooling resources and expertise from Tempest, Rocket Labs, and NZSA, the
                mission will not only push the boundaries of space exploration but also foster global cooperation in the
                quest for knowledge about our place in the universe.</p>

            <p>As the mission progresses, the team will deploy cutting-edge instruments and spacecraft to capture
                high-resolution images, collect samples, and perform detailed analyses. The data collected will be
                crucial for future space missions and may even pave the way for potential manned missions to distant
                planets or moons. This collaborative effort underscores the importance of shared scientific endeavors
                and the collective drive to uncover the secrets of our solar system.</p>
