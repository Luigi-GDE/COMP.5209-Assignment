            At tempest we dedicate our time to expanding and revolutionising on the ways which we explore the unknown,
            from the depths of our planet to the very air and space above. Innovating for the benefits of humankind and
            inspiring the world through discovery. For the last 5 years, our team at tempest has been working hard at
            designing, manufacturing, and prototyping specialized equipment to innovate space exploration. Our advanced
            technologies accelerate ongoing scientific investigations within our local solar system.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our team includes experts, who specialize in modelling and running simulations for missions, conducting
            cutting edge research and advancing technology in aeronautics. We have a range of skills that allow us to
            develop scientific instruments, durable housing for these instruments and develop satellites with the
            necessary hardware and software for research missions.
        </p>

        <p>
            We make use of advanced tools such as visual, infrared and ultraviolet cameras, magnetometer, metal
            detectors, gravimeters, light intensity sensors and radio spectrum detectors. With our propulsion system and
            other advanced technologies, in place we ensure that our equipment performs reliably and effectively in the
            conditions of space.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here at Tempest, we are currently planning to send a satellite, with scientific tools to study planets in
            our solar system. This project will be in collaboration with Rocket Labs utilizing their launch vehicles and
            satellite communication systems and receiving approval from the New Zealand Space Agency. At Tempest we are
            prepared to support space exploration with our technology and with our collaboration with Rocket Lab and all
            required authorizations secured we aspire to carry out a mission that will offer better insights into our
            solar system for the advancements of humanity and as a source of inspiration, for future generations.
