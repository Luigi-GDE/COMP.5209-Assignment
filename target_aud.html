        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <p> Target Audience
            Our primary audience includes professionals such as astronomers, astrophysicists, and planetary scientists who can
            leverage our data for further research and application.
        </p>

        <p>
            We work in collaboration with space agencies like Rocket Lab, NASA, and other global organizations to support their
            missions with our discoveries. We also provide universities and research centers with valuable data for research and
            curriculum development, fostering deeper exploration and innovation in space sciences. Educators, including teachers
            and professors, can integrate our research into their programs, offering students practical, real-world examples.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mission is to inspire and prepare the next generation of scientists, engineers, and astronauts for careers in
            space exploration. Aerospace companies and launch service providers like Rocket Lab benefit from our research to
            enhance their projects, fueling advancements in the commercial space sector.
        </p>

        <h1>How will we profit?</h1>

        <p> Tempest generates revenue through partnerships with private and governmental space agencies, universities,
            and research institutes by selling specialized research, designs, and innovative technologies. We have
            established relationships with key industry players such as SpaceX, NASA, and Blue Origin, offering them
            direct access to our research and technological advancements, which are crucial to their missions. These
            collaborations are formalized through contracts, ensuring a consistent flow of income through project work
            and deliverables.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tempest’s partnerships with governmental agencies also enable us to contribute to both national and
            international space missions, with funding secured through these agreements. Additionally, we provide
            astronaut training through our cutting-edge mission simulation technology, creating revenue streams from
            training contracts and service fees for simulation technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Universities and research institutions are increasingly adopting advanced robotics for educational and
            research purposes, and through our collaborations with these institutions, we generate revenue while
            advancing scientific research.
        </p>
        <p>
            By diversifying our revenue streams and focusing on both immediate sales and long-term partnerships,
            Tempest is set to achieve strong financial growth. This strategy not only secures our position in
            the market but also ensures that we have the financial resources we need to continue innovating and
            leading in the field of space exploration robotics.

        <h1>Scope</h1>

        <h2>Scope Included</h2>
        <p>The project includes the comprehensive design and construction of a satellite capable of housing all
            necessary equipment and enduring the extreme conditions of space launch and orbit. Our team will integrate
            advanced instruments such as visual, infrared, and ultraviolet cameras, magnetometers, metal detectors,
            gravimeters, light sensors, and radio spectrum detection tools. Power will be generated using a Radioisotope
            Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) and solar arrays, with a battery bank for storage. The propulsion system will
            rely on orthogonal electric field interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will also develop and execute rigorous testing protocols to ensure hardware and software reliability under
            simulated space conditions. Computational models and simulations will support technical analysis. Our
            project team includes a Technical Manager, Software Manager, Engineering Manager, and Telemetry Manager,
            each with their own specialized staff, ensuring the project's success.
        </p>

        <h2>Scope Excluded</h2>
        <p>
            The scope of the project does not cover the development or manufacture of the launch vehicle (rocket), which
            will be provided by Rocket Lab. Rocket Lab will also handle all aspects of the launch, including logistics
            and integration, with our team providing support as needed. Similarly, the satellite communications
            infrastructure, including ground-based satellite dishes and the necessary fiber optic networks, will be
            managed by Rocket Lab and its partners.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, securing governmental approvals and legal authority to operate space vehicles will be managed
            by the New Zealand Space Agency and Rocket Lab, while our role will be limited to supporting the application
            process. Transportation of the satellite to the launch site will be handled by a third-party logistics
            company.
        </p>



        <h1>Opportunities</h1>
        <p>
            Tempest sees this project as a transformative opportunity to elevate the company within the global space
            exploration industry. Collaborating with the New Zealand Space Agency and Rocket Lab allows us to expand our
            technological capabilities and align our advanced satellite systems with Rocket Lab’s expertise. This
            positions us as a leader in space research and innovation, paving the way for future success and growth.</p>
        <p>
            Beyond technological advancements, the data and insights we gain from this mission will hold immense value
            for both the scientific community and the broader economy. We aim to contribute to the world’s understanding
            of the solar system while driving economic growth through new technologies. This mission marks the beginning
            of many future collaborative projects, and we are excited to be at the forefront of the next era of space
